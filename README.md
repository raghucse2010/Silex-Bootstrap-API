# Silex-Bootstrap-API

This is my personal view on what should be a boilerplate for a RESTful API using Silex.

## Premises

* Should be lightweight
* Should encourage TDD
* Should include YAML/Json/PHP configuration files
* Should include Doctrine
* Should include basic authentication

## To-do

Everything! ;)

* Design and implement the suggested API structure
* Add config files support
* Add the logging component
* Add Doctrine
* Add authentication
* Add sample REST routes
* Add sample tests
* Add a console

## Future features

* Add the Facebook SDK for general use
* What else?
