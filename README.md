# Silex-Bootstrap-API - 0.1.0

This is my personal view on what should be a boilerplate for a RESTful API using Silex.

## Premises

* Should be lightweight
* Should encourage TDD
* Should include YAML/Json/PHP configuration files
* Should include Doctrine
* Should include basic authentication

## Changelog

### 0.1.0

* Logging system using monolog
* Routing system using Flint (for caching purposes)
* Basic structure route -> controller

## To-do

Almost everything! ;)

* Design and implement the suggested API structure
* Add Doctrine
* Add authentication
* Add sample REST routes
* Add sample tests
* Add a console

## Future features

* Add the Facebook SDK for general use
* What else?
