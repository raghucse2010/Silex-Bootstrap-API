# Silex-Bootstrap-API - 0.1.0

This is my personal view on what should be a boilerplate for a RESTful API using Silex.

## Premises

* Should be (very) lightweight
* Should encourage TDD
* Should include YAML/Json/PHP configuration files
* Should include Doctrine
* Should include basic authentication
* Should be fast and easily extendable

## Changelog

### 0.2.0

* Added Fractal
* Added Doctrine
* Added a simple sample model
* Added sample REST routes
* Added the first unit test!
* Added the MIT License

### 0.1.0

* Logging system using monolog
* Routing system using Flint (for caching purposes)
* Basic structure route -> controller

## To-do

Almost everything! ;)

* Design and implement the suggested API structure
* Add Doctrine ORM
* Add authentication
* Add sample tests
* Add a console
* Add EventDispatching capabilities
* Run some benchmarks to extract maximum performance out of it

## Future features

* Add the Facebook SDK for general use
* What else?
